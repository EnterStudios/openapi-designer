# Open API designer project charter

## Objective
The goal is to have an OpenAPI design tool that can be integrated with APInf platform and storage backends.

## Risks
* Misalignment with business or community goals
* Failure to execute or prioritize properly
* Miscommunication of project intent or scope

## Value proposition
User can create and edit OpenAPI documents without knowing the specification or being familiar with JSON or YAML. User is guided by user interface elements such as hints in form fields and mandatory fields and by the sequence of the form.

## Scope
* Experimental support for OpenAPI specification version 3.0
* Info texts where needed, needs should be determined via testing
* Support editing existing documents on a server
* Support better UI integration with platforms where the editor is in an iframe
* Publish the package in NPM or other such platform
* Try implementing testing with aurelia testing solutions.

## Out of scope
* Dynamic validation of the output with 3rd party solutions

## Stakeholders
* APInf API management platform and company
* Open source community, particularly people who are focused with API development and design.
